The repository TEI-2-SC contains transformations from TEI files to Shared Canvas manifests in JSON-LD, the XSL code is created in the scope of the Biblissima project.

Manifests serve to display structural and descriptive metadata alongside with the images and transcriptions of a text bearing object in a viewer like e.g. Mirador (developed by Stanford University) see for example http://demos.biblissima-condorcet.fr/mirador .

In a first step two transformation for transcriptions to Shared Canvas (a using facsimile module, b using sourceDesc) 

and an XSL that 

automatically adds facsimile surfaces and zones as estimates to a TEI file with a transcription, taking the position of a writing area and calculating the zone of each line.
